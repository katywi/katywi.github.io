    <p>Fashion from 1910â€“1919 in the Western world, was characterized by a rich and exotic opulence.</p>
    <p>In contrast with the somber practicality of garments worn during the Great War.</p>
    <p>Men's trousers were worn</p>

    	<ol>
    		<p>cuffed to ankle-length</p>
    		<p>and creased</p>
    	</ol>

    <p>Skirts rose from floor length to well above the ankle and women began to bob their hair.</p>
